# vba_challenge

## Overview of project
The aim of this challenge is to produce an analysis of a dataset, in this case the stock market, via one click, using VBA. Additionally, by refactoring the initial code we aim to make the analysis even faster.

## Stock Performance
### 2017
The stock performance in 2017 is mostly positive (10 out of 11 stock went up in volume). Only 1 stock (TERP) went down (-7.2%).
DQ, ENPH, SEDG, and FSLR have the best performance as they have more than doubled their volume.

### 2018
The stock performance in 2018 is mostly negative (9 out of 11 stocks went down in volume). Only 2 stocks went up (ENPH and RUN). 
JKS, and DQ have the worst return.

### Comparison
If we compare both years, ENPH would have been the best stock to invest in as the return was positive across both years.

## Summary 

### Advantages & Disadvantages of refactoring a code
If it was the first time we look at this data, refactoring the code will allow a better understanding and visibility over the dataset.
It will also give an idea of the extent of the data (by execution time) and set a standard of what was done prior to us.
The inconvenient to refactoring a code is that it could introduce more bugs and mistakes into something that may be longer but it's working.
